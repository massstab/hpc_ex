<h3>EX1:</h3>

Everything worked.

<h3>EX2:</h3>
I wrote a script (`pymapred.sh`) which outputs the map&reduce procedure in the 'pymared.out' file. I had to change to python2 because my system calls python3 by default.
Then I run everything on hadoop. This was easy. There was a folder output created and inside where two files. `_SUCCESS` and `part-00000`.

Couldn't find the file via the api. In the FINISHED Applocations tab there was the job with the ID `application_1620389492472_0001` which was a link and on that page all the information for the job was summarized. No output file was there. Only Log Aggregation Status: 	DISABLED. Maybe it was that?
